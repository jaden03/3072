Simple clone of 2048 I made while learning Swift and Xcode

It does not detect losing and it still spawns a number even if nothing changed after you swiped, but it is still pretty fun.
I would have liked to make it more animated but it wouldnt have been possible with the way I used text labels in a grid.
